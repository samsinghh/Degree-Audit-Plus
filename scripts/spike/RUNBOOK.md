# DAP-115 (5.1) POC runbook

Throwaway spike for [DAP-115](https://linear.app/longhorn-devs/issue/DAP-115/51-poc-planner-mechanics-preview-timing)
and its sub-issues DAP-122 / DAP-123 / DAP-124.

Everything here needs a **real authenticated UT session (SSO + Duo)**, so it
runs on your device, not in CI and not from an agent. `planner-poc.js` is the
harness; this file is the script you follow.

Delete `scripts/spike/` once the findings are folded into
`docs/hypothetical-courses-design.md`.

---

## ✅ TODO — everything left, in order

Sections below have the detail. **Step 2 is the only thing DAP-115 is blocked
on**; 3–5 are follow-ups.

### 0. Get a session

In a fresh browser you have none. Log in at
<https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/degree/audits/> (SSO + Duo), then paste
`planner-poc.js` into a DevTools console **on that UT page**. Django checks
`Referer` on the audit POST, so a random tab won't do.

If `readPlanner()` throws "Not logged in", the session didn't take — re-auth
and reload before continuing.

### 1. Take stock of the planner (~1 min)

> A new browser gives you a fresh _session_, not a fresh _planner_. The planner
> lives on UT's server as one global list per student, so any rows left by
> earlier runs are still there. Look before deleting.

```js
await poc.readPlanner(); // what does UT actually have right now?
```

Then decide from the output:

- **Only your real courses** (e.g. `AFR305`, `C S331`) → nothing to do, go to
  step 2.
- **Leftover spike rows** — duplicate `C S324E` entries from the failed timing
  runs. Delete the extras, but keep any course you actually plan to take:

  ```js
  const rows = await poc.readPlanner();
  // Inspect first, delete second. `rows` shows rowText so you can eyeball it.
  for (const row of rows.filter((r) => r.key_course_id === "C S324E")) {
    await poc.testDelete(row);
  }
  ```

  If `C S324E` is a course you genuinely want planned, keep one row and delete
  only the duplicates (`rows.filter(...).slice(1)`).

Stale rows change what the audit returns, so get this right before timing.

### 2. Run the timing ⭐ (~5 min) — this is the deliverable

**Run:**

```js
await poc.timePreview({ dept: "C S", num: "324E", ccyys: "20272" }, 5);
```

No extra arguments — the form shape is known now. This creates **5 real audits**
in your UT history and adds/deletes one planner row per run.

**Expect:** five `--- round trip N/5` blocks, each logging
`round trip {resolveMs, addMs, submitMs, generateMs, scrapeMs, deleteMs,
totalMs, auditId}`, then a `console.table` at the end.

**Record:** right-click the table → Copy, or run `poc.timingTable()` again. You
want the p50/p95 row per stage.

**Judge it:**

| Result               | Meaning                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| p95 `totalMs` < 15 s | ✅ Eager-verify holds. Ticket's core question answered.  |
| p95 `totalMs` > 15 s | 🚩 **Flag DAP-114** — reopens the eager-verify decision  |
| Table prints `{}`    | Every run failed; read the error and see Troubleshooting |

**If it fails:** the error names the stage. `Planned Courses checkbox not found`
→ run `await poc.dumpAuditForm()`. A 403/CSRF → you're not on a UT page. The
harness stops after 2 consecutive failures rather than burning all five.

### 3. Re-run parallel adds (~3 min)

The earlier verdict was unsound (it couldn't tell a race from UT rejecting a
course). The test now runs a serial baseline first.

**Run — 2 or 3 times, since races are flaky:**

```js
await poc.testParallelAdd([
  { dept: "C S", num: "324E", ccyys: "20272" },
  { dept: "C S", num: "331", ccyys: "20272" },
  { dept: "C S", num: "429H", ccyys: "20272" },
]);
await poc.cleanup(); // between each run
```

**Read two findings in the output:**

- `add.serialBaseline` — which courses UT accepts one at a time. A course
  missing here was never a concurrency problem; swap in a different one.
- `add.parallel` — the verdict:

| Output                                               | Meaning                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `allLanded: true`, `duplicateSeq: false`, repeatable | Parallel writes look safe              |
| `allLanded: false`                                   | 🚩 **Serialize planner writes** in 5.2 |
| `duplicateSeq: true`                                 | 🚩 Serialize — seq assignment collided |

### 4. Follow the Modify URL (~5 min) — manual, no harness

**Do:** open DevTools → Network tab, then paste this into the address bar
(swap in a `key_course_seq` from your own `readPlanner()` output):

```text
https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/degree/audits/planner/modify_planned_course/?key_course_id=C%20S324E&key_course_ccyys=20272&key_course_seq=996&key_course_type=1&action_code=M
```

Change the term or pass/fail, submit, and in the Network tab click the submit
request.

**Record:** its **method** (GET or POST), its **URL**, and its **form data /
query params** (the "Payload" tab). That's the shape DAP-129 needs.

### 5. DAP-123 captures (~10 min) — two contexts the page console can't give you

**5a — service worker.** Run `bun run dev`, load the extension, open
`chrome://extensions` → Degree Audit + → click **service worker**. Paste
`planner-poc.js` there and run:

```js
await poc.testExecutionContext();
```

**Record** `cookiesRodeAlong`, `domParserAvailable`, `parsedPlannerRows`.
Expect `domParserAvailable: false` (MV3 has no DOM) — that's fine. The question
that matters is **`cookiesRodeAlong`**: if true, the background can fetch and
hand parsing elsewhere, which makes 5.4's pipeline much simpler.

**5b — logged out.** Open an incognito window, go to a UT audit URL **without
logging in**, paste the harness, and run:

```js
await poc.testAuthSignal();
```

**Record** which fields differ from your logged-in run. Whichever flips most
cheaply becomes the auth gate. This matters because `response.redirected` —
what `session.ts` uses today — is **true on a successful planner add**, so it
can't be the signal for writes.

### Optional (only if you have time)

- **Planner max rows:** `await poc.testAdd(...)` repeatedly until UT complains.
  Bail at ~15–20 and record where you stopped rather than inventing a number.
- **Closed term:** add a course for a past `ccyys` — rejected, or silently
  parenthesized?

### Finish

```js
poc.report(); // prints every finding collected this session
await poc.cleanup(); // planner back to how you found it
await poc.readPlanner(); // verify
```

Then: post the timing table on DAP-115, check off the table in
`docs/hypothetical-courses-design.md` § "Remaining unknowns", attach
before/after planner screenshots, and delete `scripts/spike/`.

---

> Everything below is **reference** — the mechanics behind each step, and what
> earlier runs already established. The checklist above is what to actually do.

## Ground rules

- **Screenshot the planner as-is** (View Courses) before you start. You need a
  before/after pair as proof.
- Pick a throwaway course you don't mind appearing in UT's planner log — the
  planner is one global list per student and UT logs every change. Use a course
  you'd never actually plan, in the next semester's `ccyys` (e.g. `20272`).
- `page=4` (add) and `action_code=D` (delete) are **state-changing GETs**.
  Don't re-run cells casually and don't let DevTools replay requests.

## Load the harness

Open DevTools on any `utdirect.utexas.edu` audits page, paste the whole of
`planner-poc.js` into the console, hit enter. It exposes `poc`.

```js
await poc.readPlanner(); // sanity check: prints existing rows + their keys
```

If that throws "Not logged in", your session is dead — re-auth and reload.

## Why leftover rows matter

Earlier timing runs each added a row and died before deleting it, leaving
duplicate `C S324E` entries. That leak is fixed — cleanup now runs in a
`finally` — but rows written before the fix are still on UT's server, since the
planner is server-side and a new browser doesn't reset it.

Leftover rows change what a planned-inclusive audit returns, which is why step 1
above says look before you measure. Prefer a targeted filter over
`deleteAllCourses()`: it leaves your real rows untouched instead of wiping and
restoring them.

## DAP-122 — mostly done ✅

Confirmed on 2026-08-05 (recorded in
`docs/hypothetical-courses-design.md` § "Confirmed"):

| Question                   | Answer                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Add via `page=4`           | Works, ~409 ms, `200` + redirect to `ut_course/`            |
| Delete via `action_code=D` | Works, ~259 ms, `200`, no redirect, exact row               |
| Duplicate add              | **Creates a duplicate row** — not a no-op                   |
| `key_course_seq`           | Counts **down** from 999 (999, 998, 997 …) — never hardcode |
| `key_course_id`            | dept+num, separator dropped: `C S` + `324E` → `C S324E`     |
| Nonexistent course         | No `page=4` link on `page=3`; no distinct error page        |
| Modify URL                 | Found — see below                                           |

**Modify** (discovered, not yet followed):

```text
/apps/degree/audits/planner/modify_planned_course/
  ?key_course_id=C S324E&key_course_ccyys=20272
  &key_course_seq=996&key_course_type=1&action_code=M
```

Still to do — open that URL in a real tab, change the term or pass/fail, submit,
and record from the Network tab what the browser actually sends. Note it carries
an extra `key_course_type` that delete doesn't, so modify's row key is a
**4-tuple**. DAP-129 needs the submit shape.

**Still open — planner limits (#6):**

```js
// Add rows one at a time until UT complains. Bail at ~15–20 if nothing does.
await poc.testAdd({ dept: "C S", num: "429H", ccyys: "20272" });
```

Record where you stopped rather than inventing a number, then `poc.cleanup()`.

Also still open: add a course for an **already-closed term** — does UT reject
it, or silently parenthesize it? (Parenthesized rows don't apply to audits, so
5.4 must treat them as sync failures.)

## Parallel adds (#8) — first result was inconclusive

The 2026-08-05 run returned `requested: 3, rowsCreated: 2, allLanded: false`
and the harness declared "UT needs serialized writes." **That conclusion wasn't
sound**, and the test has been fixed.

A missing row has two possible causes, and the old test couldn't tell them
apart:

1. A real concurrency race dropped a write.
2. UT rejected that specific course on its own merits — restricted, already
   taken, closed term. `C S 429H` had a `page=4` link but may never have been
   addable at all.

The evidence actually leaned toward **cause 2**: `duplicateSeq: false` with
clean sequential seqs `996, 997, 998` is what orderly assignment looks like,
not a corrupted race.

The test now establishes a **serial baseline first** — it adds each course one
at a time, notes which UT actually accepts, deletes them, and only then races
the courses proven to be addable. Now a shortfall means concurrency, full stop.

```js
await poc.testParallelAdd([
  { dept: "C S", num: "324E", ccyys: "20272" },
  { dept: "C S", num: "331", ccyys: "20272" },
  { dept: "C S", num: "429H", ccyys: "20272" },
]);
await poc.cleanup();
```

Read the output in two parts:

- `add.serialBaseline` — which courses UT accepts at all. If `C S 429H` is
  missing here, it was never a concurrency problem. Swap in another course.
- `add.parallel` — `allLanded: false` or `duplicateSeq: true` now genuinely
  means **serialize planner writes** in 5.2.

Races are flaky by nature, so **run it 2–3 times** before concluding parallel
is safe. One clean pass isn't proof.

## Delete All

Built as `poc.deleteAllCourses()` — but implemented as a **loop of per-row
deletes**, not UT's `action_code=A`. Same end state, three advantages: it
prints a restorable snapshot before touching anything, it reports exactly which
rows resisted deletion, and it can't half-fire into an unknown state. UT has no
undo, so that snapshot is the only way back.

```js
// Requires the exact confirmation string, so a stray paste can't fire it.
const { snapshot } = await poc.deleteAllCourses("DELETE ALL");
```

Copy the printed snapshot somewhere before continuing. To put things back:

```js
await poc.restoreFromSnapshot(snapshot);
```

Restore is **best-effort**: `key_course_seq` is UT-assigned so restored rows get
new numbers, and a course whose term has since closed won't re-add. It reports
what failed rather than pretending it round-tripped.

> Note this doesn't change the product policy — the design doc still says
> automated Delete All never ships to users, and the acceptance criteria still
> require per-row confirmation. This is spike tooling for resetting your own
> planner between runs.

## DAP-123 — what it's actually asking

Two questions that together decide **where the planner client lives**. Neither
is about the planner's behavior; both are about our extension's plumbing.

### Q1: Where can the planner code run?

A Chrome extension has two places to make requests, and they have different
powers:

|             | Content script (on a UT page)             | Background service worker                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Runs when   | Only while a UT tab is open               | Any time, no tab needed                    |
| Origin      | `utdirect.utexas.edu` — cookies automatic | Extension origin; needs `host_permissions` |
| `DOMParser` | Yes (it's a real page)                    | **No** — MV3 workers have no DOM           |

This matters because the whole preview flow is a background job — add, submit,
poll for ~seconds, scrape. If it must run in a content script, then **the user
closing that UT tab kills the preview mid-flight**, and 5.4 needs a
tab-lifetime strategy (there's already a known bug: the temp tab dies at 30 s
while the poll window is 90 s). If the worker can do it, the pipeline is far
simpler and more robust.

Everything you ran so far was in a **page console**, which is the
content-script case — so Q1's first half is already answered: it works there.
What's untested is the worker.

```js
await poc.testExecutionContext(); // you've effectively done this one
```

Now load the unpacked extension (`bun run dev`), open `chrome://extensions` →
Degree Audit + → **service worker**, paste `planner-poc.js` there, run the same
line. `host_permissions` for `utdirect.utexas.edu/*` is already in the manifest,
so the real questions are whether **cookies ride along** and whether parsing is
possible.

> Expect `domParserAvailable: false` — MV3 workers have no DOM. That alone
> doesn't settle it: if `cookiesRodeAlong` is true, the worker can fetch and
> hand the HTML to a content script or offscreen document to parse. A
> hybrid (fetch in worker, parse in page) may well be the answer.

### Q2: How do we know the session died?

Every planner write assumes a live session. If it's dead, we must stop _before_
writing — a half-completed preview leaves stray rows in a planner we can't
clean up. So we need a check that's cheap enough to run before every operation
and correct enough to trust.

```js
await poc.testAuthSignal(); // while logged IN — you have this data
```

Then log out (or use an incognito window) and run it again. Whichever field
flips most cheaply is the gate.

> **Your run already found a problem here.** The successful add returned
> `redirected: true`. Today
> [session.ts:39-46](../../features/session/session.ts#L39-L46) treats
> `response.redirected` as logged-out — which is fine for the read-only history
> probe it guards, but **would misread a successful planner add as a dead
> session.** That's the same bug that produced "Session died mid-add" in the
> harness. 5.2 must not reuse that check for writes. The logged-out capture
> tells us what to use instead.

## DAP-124 — preview round-trip timing (blocked → unblock it first)

The 2026-08-05 attempt produced **no timings at all**: every round trip died at
submit with `Request with GET/HEAD method cannot have body`. Two bugs, both now
fixed in the harness:

1. UT's audit form is a **GET** form — params must go in the query string, not
   a request body.
2. The harness grabbed the page's _first_ `<form>`, which is site search, not
   the audit form. That's why the Planned Courses checkbox came up missing.

**The form shape is now known** (from your `dumpAuditForm()` run, 2026-08-05).
It's form index 2 of 3 on the page:

| Property        | Value                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Method          | **POST** (not GET)                                           |
| Action          | `""` — posts to `student_individual/` itself                 |
| CSRF            | `csrfmiddlewaretoken` (Django)                               |
| Include-options | checkboxes `current` / `future` / `planned`, all `value="X"` |
| Submit          | `name="audit"`, `value="Submit Audit"`                       |

So the Planned Courses checkbox is **`name="planned"`, `value="X"`** — that's
now the harness default. Just run:

```js
await poc.timePreview({ dept: "C S", num: "324E", ccyys: "20272" }, 5);
```

No third argument needed. (The earlier attempt passed the literal placeholder
`"THE_NAME_YOU_FOUND"` — but the real bug was mine: the form picker grabbed
UT's _site search_ form, which has no checkboxes at all, hence
`checkboxCandidates: []`. It now identifies the audit form by looking for the
`planned` checkbox itself.)

`submitPlannedAudit` still **throws rather than silently submitting without the
checkbox**, because a run that excludes planned courses measures the wrong
thing entirely. It also surfaces a Django CSRF rejection (403) instead of
polling for an audit that was never queued.

> Run this from a console **on the UT audit page**, not from a random tab —
> Django checks the `Referer` on POST, and a mismatch is rejected.

Five full round trips: resolve → add → submit → poll raw history for the new ID
→ scrape → delete. Prints a `console.table` of p50/p95 per stage.

This creates **one real audit per run** in your UT history. Five is the ticket's
minimum; don't run many more. The harness now stops after 2 consecutive
failures instead of grinding through all five.

Watch for:

- **p95 total > 15 s** → flag on DAP-114. That reopens the eager-verify
  decision, which is the whole point of measuring.
- `addMs` includes the success redirect, since that's the real cost the
  production client pays — just don't read it as pure server time.

## Troubleshooting

**"Session died mid-add" / "mid-delete"** — fixed. The old auth guard treated
`response.redirected` as logged-out, but UT's `page=4` and `action_code=D`
endpoints _redirect on success_, so a working add aborted with a scary error
after already writing the row. Mutations now report all auth signals and let
the planner before/after diff decide the outcome. If you loaded the harness
before this fix, re-paste it — and check View Courses for rows the aborted runs
left behind.

**Add reports 0 new rows** — either UT rejected it or the course was already
planned. Check `add.responseSignals` in the console for what UT actually
returned; that's also raw material for DAP-123.

**"Request with GET/HEAD method cannot have body"** — fixed. The harness had
the method backwards: UT's audit form is **POST**, and it was building a GET.

**"Planned Courses checkbox not found"** — the harness picked the wrong form.
Fixed: it now identifies the audit form by the `planned` checkbox itself. If it
recurs, UT changed the page — run `await poc.dumpAuditForm()` and pass
`{ plannedCheckboxName: "..." }` to `timePreview()`.

**"Audit submit rejected (403) — likely CSRF"** — you're running from a console
that isn't on a UT page. Django checks `Referer` on POST. Open a
`utdirect.utexas.edu` audit page and paste the harness there.

**Rows piling up after failed timing runs** — fixed. Cleanup now runs in a
`finally`, so a failure mid-round-trip still deletes that run's row. Rows
written before the fix must be removed manually (step 1 of the checklist).
